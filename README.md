# V5GL
VEX V5 graphics library for python. Contains everything required to add a beautiful GUI to your programs, all in a simple, fast, and familiar package.

# Development Status
Before using it on your competition robot, it should be noted that V5GL is still in an early development phase, and should therefore only be used by people with a fair bit of experience with Python, as well as a willingness to fix (hopefully contribute these fixes!) any bugs that may arise.

If you do decide to use this on your robot, please note that you really need to use an SD card. This allows you to have many more images and graphics, even some videos!

Stay tuned for more!
